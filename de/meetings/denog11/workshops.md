<h3> 14:00 - 17:00: BGP Community Framework, Communities & Ansible automation</h3>
<b> Peter Sievers, Sebastian Graf </b>
In this hands-on workshop the following topics will be covered.
Determine BGP behavior with import- and export policies,
adjust BGP attributes to influence the behavior of the local router
as well as other routers receiving the route.
BGP route manipulation and handling will be shown by using
BGP communities which are associated with a BGP route.

The second part of the workshop will show how to automate the
configuration of network devices using Ansible and Jinja2 templates.

The theory of BGP, Ansible and Automation is presented in a
vendor-neutral way.
The practical configuration examples are shown using Junos
and made available as Hands-on Cli.<br>
